                Finding a regular playgroup that matches your schedule, power
                level and vibe is not the easiest thing to do, especially when
                you&apos;re in a new country or if you&apos;re just getting back
                into the game.

              <p className=" black mb-3 text-xl">
                With established cliques at the local game stores, it&apos;s
                often difficult, and a little awkward to ask to join a game and
                to be looped into the group&apos;s regular meetups.

                And thatâ€™s what Dungeon Meetup is for.

              <p className=" black mb-3 text-xl">
                Dungeon Meetup provides you a platform to create playgroups or
                join existing ones located in your area. It&apos;s a way for you
                to get plugged into the community and start playing regularly
                immediately.
              </p>
              <p className=" black mb-3 text-xl">
                You don&apos;t have to worry about any awkward interactions
                because the people here are already looking for more players,
                and will be happy to induct new ones into their playgroups.
